## Statements and Functions

***Statement***
- A statement is a logical set of instructions that tell your browser what to do.
- In our case, we just have one:

/>

How can you tell if something is a statement?
- You can tell something is a statement by looking at the **last character**.
- It is usually a **semicolon( ; )** just like what you see here.

***Function***
- A function is basically a reusable chuch of code that does something.
- The "someting" it does could be defined by you, defined by some third-party library you are using, or it could be defined by the JaaSript frameword itself.

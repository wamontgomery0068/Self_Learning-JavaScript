# What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a modern-day programming language that is a peer of HTML and CSS. In a nutshell, **it allows you to add interactivity to your document**. Here is a short list of things you can do with JavaScript:
- **Listen to events** like a mouse click and do something.
- **Modify the HTML and CSS** of your page after the page has loaded.
- Make things move around the screen in interesting ways.
- Create awesome games that work in the browser like Cut the Rope.
- **Communicate data between the server and the broswer**.
- Allow you to interact with a webcam, microphone, and other devices.

The following example shows some old-fashioned, fresh out the kitchen JavaScript:
